The script should feature 2-3 simple, friendly characters (e.g., "Pip" the curious mouse, "Sparky" the energetic squirrel, "Professor Whiskers" the wise old owl).
The script must:
- Clearly label speaker turns (e.g., "Pip:", "Sparky:", "Professor Whiskers:").
- Include brief, parenthetical descriptions for simple actions, expressions, or scene settings (e.g., "(Pip scratches head, looking confused)", "(Panel: They are looking at a large diagram of a plant cell)", "(Sparky jumps up and down excitedly)").
- Ensure the language is age-appropriate, engaging, and uses simple vocabulary.
- The main goal is to explain the topic effectively through their dialogue and the described visual cues.
- Keep the overall comic dialogue concise, ideally fitting into a few panels if it were drawn.
- Example snippet:
  Pip: Professor Whiskers, what IS photosynthesis? (Pip looks up, puzzled, at a large green leaf)
  Professor Whiskers: (Smiling gently) Ah, Pip! Photosynthesis is like a plant's way of making its own food! (Panel: Professor Whiskers points to the sun and then to the leaf)
  Sparky: Food? Like nuts and berries? (Sparky holds up an acorn)
